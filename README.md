# Motor-Driver-Repository
Code for running motor drivers


This repository includes C-code for running the motor drivers. 
MotorDriver.c is the implementation of the code, where the I/O is set, and the 'work' is actually done.

Motor test is a test main that can be used to test out running the motors.
